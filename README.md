This project creates an AI that plays the common game of gin rummy.

We are going to develop a few classes that can be implemented over the next couple weeks. Light
commenting will be provided. 

PATHS:
Alex, to use the tests properly, I have created a script called test_all.py. This script will auto
run all of our tests and show you the failures. However, for any of the tests to work. You need to
add this package to your path. The way I did it was 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/you/want/to/add
in the terminal. My actual command looked like
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH: /luke/home/PycharmProjects/rummyaibot/
You will have to do something similar although I do not know the exact paths for linux.
