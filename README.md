This project creates an AI that plays the common game of gin rummy.


Travis-ci:
Right now travis is configured to allow nightly failrues and wokr on 3.6 and 3.8. The path is
currently poorly set, but will work for what we need it to do.

Paths:
Add this to you ~/.bashrc at the bottom. Everytime you open a terminal it will add the correct
directory to your python path. 

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/my/other/path"
